## 🚀 Share Your Code Snippets and Markdown Notes

NoteFlicks allows you to easily share your markdown documents and code snippets with anyone. Below is a demonstration of various markdown elements you can use:

### 📝 Headings

Headings are created by adding one or more \`#\` symbols before your heading text. The number of \`#\` you use will determine the size of the heading.

### ✨Text Styles

- **Bold Text**: Wrap your text with \`**\` or \`__\` to make it bold.
- *Italic Text*: Wrap your text with \`*\` or \`_\` to make it italic.
- ~~Strikethrough~~: Wrap your text with \`~~\` to strike it through.

### 📋 Lists

#### 🔹 Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2

#### 🔢 Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem 2.1
   2. Subitem 2.2

### 💻 Code

To display inline code, wrap it in backticks: \`inline code\`.

For code blocks, wrap your code in triple backticks:

\`\`\`
const greet = () => {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
\`\`\`

You can also specify the language for syntax highlighting:

\`\`\`javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
\`\`\`


### 📖 Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are used to include quoted text. You can nest blockquotes by adding additional \`>\` symbols.

### 📊 Tables

Create tables by separating columns with pipes \`|\` and using hyphens \`-\` to separate the header from the rows.

| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |

### ➖ Horizontal Rule

To create a horizontal line, use three or more asterisks \`***\`, dashes \`---\`, or underscores \`___\`.
